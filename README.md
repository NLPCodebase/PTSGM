# PTSGM
PTSGMï¼šPrompt-Tuning Sequence Generation Model for Event Causality Identification

# Introduction of Code
We provide three different sets of codes for different datasets and experimental settings.  

Each set of codes corresponds to a different experimental setup, but there are no structural changes.  

Taking the event_storyline as an example:  

makedataset_eventstoryline.py corresponds to the template creation module.  

train_eventstoryline.py corresponds to the prompt-tunning module.  

inference_eventstoryline.py corresponds to the relation inference module.  

# Introduction of Data
Similarly, three different sets of dataset examples are provided in the this folder.
