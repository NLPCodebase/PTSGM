# Introduction of Code
We provide a total of four different sets of codes for different datasets and experimental settings.  

Each set of codes corresponds to a different experimental setup, but there are no structural changes.  

Taking the event_storyline as an example:  

The files in this folder are the code to experiment on this dataset.  

makedataset_eventstoryline.py corresponds to the creat template module.  

train_eventstoryline.py corresponds to the relation inference module.  

inference_eventstoryline.py corresponds to the relation inference module.  


# Introduction of Data
Similarly, the dataset also provides four different dataset examples.  

At the same time, we provide methods to create a dataset for fine-tuning BART in the code.
